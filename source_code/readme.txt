for project 5, the new functions are:
- aggregation_cost
- find_path_from_aggregation_matrix
- wisdom_of_crowds
- wisdom_of_crowds1
- plot_agreement( we need plot_agreement function to plot the agreement and the cost)

All these functions are detailed in the report



we need visualize_points.m visualize_road.m path_cost.m and GUI_AI.m 
for the GUI (the wisodm of crowds method is still not integrated in the GUI)
